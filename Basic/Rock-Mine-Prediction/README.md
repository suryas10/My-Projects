# Rock vs. Mine Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying whether a given set of sonar readings corresponds to a rock or a mine. The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using a dataset of sonar readings. These readings represent reflected sound waves and are analyzed to distinguish between rocks and metal cylinders (representing mines).

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Description**: Each instance in the dataset contains 60 attributes, each representing a measure of the energy within a specific frequency band.
- **Classes**: The target variable has two categories:
    - Rock
    - Mine

## Requirements
To run the notebook and replicate the results, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these packages using **pip**:

```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure
- Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- README.md: Project documentation.

## Implementation Details
`1.` Data Preprocessing:
      - Data loading and exploration
      - Data normalization and feature scaling
      
`2.` Model Selection:
      - Multiple models were considered, such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines.
      
`3.` Model Training and Evaluation:
      - The models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
      - Cross-validation was used to ensure the robustness of the results.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set. Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrices are provided in the notebook.

## How to Run
`1.` Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suryas10/ML-Projects/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
```
`2.` Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface and run the cells sequentially.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques.
- Try deep learning models for potentially better performance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.
